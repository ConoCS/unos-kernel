# Welcome to My Most Dedicated Repo:
# **UNOS-KERNEL**
_UnosKernel? Sounds AWESOME, right?!_

Hehe, thanks. This is just a personal side project I’ve been building solo in my free time at home (and of course, to impress my parents 😎).

## 1. What is UnOS, and where did the name come from?
Back when I was a kid, I used to dream of creating a big OS like Windows or Ubuntu. 
Now that I finally have a decent laptop, I thought… why not just make it for real? That’s how **UnOS** was born. 
I picked the name “Un” randomly when I was younger, and since it didn’t really mean anything, I made up a full name when I got older:

> **Unified Nation Technology** (crickets chirping...)

## 2. Do I want this OS to be as big as Windows?
Nope. Not aiming for that, and not expecting it either.  
From the start, I’ve always had this mindset:  
> *“As long as **I** can use it, that's enough.”*

## 3. Does it work on real hardware?
At the moment… I can’t guarantee it.  
(Tried it on my own machine and it didn’t work—no idea why 😭)  
But in the future? Absolutely!  
UnOS aims to support real hardware, from old-school UEFI-compatible machines to modern systems.

## 4. Is this a VM-only OS?
For now, yes. It runs on VirtualBox and QEMU just fine.  
Not sure about VMware, though—I don't have enough space to download it and test. 😅

---

## 5. Want to contribute?
I’d love that!  
Working together on this would be awesome.  
Even if you use AI to help with the code—no worries at all. I personally review and filter every piece of code to make sure it’s safe and actually works.

Thanks for stopping by.
